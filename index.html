    <h1>Tips for Financial Cybersecurity</h1>

    <h2>Use Strong and Unique Passwords</h2>
    <p>Creating strong and unique passwords is one of the most effective ways to protect financial accounts. Passwords should include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using personal information such as names, birthdays, or mobile numbers. Using different passwords for different accounts ensures that if one account is compromised, others remain safe.</p>

    <h2>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h2>
    <p>Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification in addition to a password. This could be a one-time code sent to a mobile phone, an authentication app, or biometric verification. Even if someone steals your password, 2FA prevents unauthorized access to your financial accounts.</p>

    <h2>Beware of Phishing Scams</h2>
    <p>Phishing scams are fraudulent messages or emails that appear to come from trusted institutions like banks. These messages often ask for personal or financial details. Always check the sender’s identity and avoid clicking on suspicious links. Banks never request sensitive information such as passwords, PINs, or OTPs through email or messages.</p>

    <h2>Keep Devices and Software Updated</h2>
    <p>Updating your devices, operating systems, and banking applications is essential for financial cybersecurity. Updates often include security patches that fix known vulnerabilities. Using outdated software increases the risk of malware attacks and unauthorized access to sensitive financial data.</p>

    <h2>Use Secure Networks for Banking</h2>
    <p>Avoid accessing financial accounts using public Wi-Fi networks, as they are often insecure. If you must use public internet, consider using a trusted VPN for encryption. Always secure home Wi-Fi networks with strong passwords to protect online banking activities.</p>

    <h2>Monitor Accounts Regularly</h2>
    <p>Regularly checking bank statements and transaction histories helps identify suspicious activities early. Enable SMS or email alerts for transactions. Quick detection allows immediate action, reducing financial losses and improving overall account security.</p>
